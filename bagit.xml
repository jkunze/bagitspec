  <abstract>

<t>
This document specifies BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format for
storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content. A "bag" has just enough
structure to enclose descriptive metadata "tags" and a file "payload" but
does not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics. This
BagIt format should be suitable for reliable storage and transfer.
</t>

  </abstract>

 </front>

<middle>
<section title="Introduction">
<section title="Purpose">
<t>
BagIt is a hierarchical file packaging format designed to support
storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.
A bag consists of a directory containing the payload files and other accompanying
metadata files known as "tag" files. The "tags" are metadata files intended to
facilitate and document the storage and transfer of the bag. Processing a bag
does not require any understanding of the payload file contents and the payload
can be accessed without processing the BagIt metadata.
</t>

<t>
The name, BagIt, is inspired by the "enclose and deposit" method
<xref target="ENCDEP" />, sometimes referred to as "bag it and tag it".
BagIt differs from traditional archive formats such as TAR or ZIP in two general
areas:

<list style="numbers">
  <t>
    Strong integrity assurances: the format supports only cryptographic-quality
    hash algorithms (see <xref target="bag-checksum-algorithms" />) and allows
    for in-place upgrades to add additional manifests using stronger algorithms
    without breaking backwards compatibility
  </t>
  <t>
    Direct file access: files may be accessed using standard operating system
    utilities, implementations do not need to process a potentially large
    archive file to extract a subset of data, and the format imposes no size
    limits for either individual files or a bag.
  </t>
</list>
</t>
</section> <!-- /Purpose -->

<section title="Requirements">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

<t>
  Implementors are strongly encouraged to review the interoperability
  considerations described in <xref target="sec-interoperability" />.
</t>
</section> <!-- /Requirements -->

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
  The following terms have precise definitions as used in this specification:
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="bag">
    A order independent set of opaque files contained within the structure
    defined by this specification.
  </t>

  <t hangText="bag declaration">
    The file required to be in all bags conforming to this specification.
    Contains values necessary to process the rest of a bag.
    See <xref target="sec-bag-decl"/>.
  </t>

  <t hangText="bag checksum algorithm">
    The name of a cryptographic checksum algorithm which has been normalized
    for use in a manifest or tag manifest file name (e.g. "SHA-1" becomes
    "sha1") as described in <xref target="bag-checksum-algorithms" />.
  </t>

  <t hangText="payload">
    The data encapsulated by the bag. The contents of the payload
    are opaque to this specification, and, with respect to BagIt processing,
    are always considered as an opaque octet stream.
    See <xref target="sec-payload-dir" />.
  </t>

  <t hangText="tag directory">
    A directory that contains one or more tag files.
  </t>

  <t hangText="tag file">
    A file which contains metadata. The specification defines two standard tag
    files: tag manifests, which describe other tag files
    <xref target="sec-tag-manifest" />, and the "bag-info.txt" file containing
    human-meaningful metadata <xref target="sec-bag-info" />.

    The specification also allows other arbitrary tag files as described in
    <xref target="sec-other-tag-files" />.
  </t>

  <t hangText="complete">
    A bag which contains every element required by this specification,
    every payload file listed in a manifest, and any optional files which are
    listed in a tag manifest. See <xref target="sec-complete-valid" />.
  </t>

  <t hangText="valid">
    A complete bag where every checksum in every manifest has been
    successfully verified against the corresponding file.

A tag manifest is a tag file that lists other tag files and checksums for
those tag files generated using a particular bag checksum algorithm.
A bag &may; contain one or more tag manifests.

A tag manifest file &must; have a name of the form "tagmanifest-<spanx

A tag manifest file has the same form as the payload file manifest

The "bag-info.txt" file is a tag file that contains metadata elements

the "bag-info.txt" file are intended primarily for human use.
All metadata elements are optional and &may; be repeated. Implementations
&must; assume that the ordering is significant and provide access to the
metadata elements in the order they are given in the "bag-info.txt" file.

A metadata element &must; consist of a label, a colon, and a value,
each separated by optional whitespace. It is &recommended; that
lines not exceed 79 characters in length. Long values may be continued

<section title="Special directory characters">
<!-- Added by Brian Vargas, 2009-04-09 -->
<t>
The paths specified in the payload manifest, and tag manifest file do not
prohibit special directory characters which might be significant on
implementing systems. Implementors &must; ensure that files outside the bag
directory structure are not accessed when reading or writing files based on
paths specified in a bag.
</t>

<t>
For example, a maliciously crafted "tagmanifest-md5.txt" file might
contain entries which begin with a path character such as "/", "..",
or a "~username" home directory reference in an attempt to cause a
naive implementation to leak or overwrite targeted files.
All implementations &should; have a test suite to guard against these cases.
</t>

<t>
  Windows implementations &should; test their implementations to ensure
  that safety-checks prevent use of drive letters and the less commonly used
  namespace sequences (e.g. "\\?\C:\…") described in <xref target="MSFNAM" />.

<section title="Practical Considerations (non-normative)">
<section title="Interoperability" anchor="sec-interoperability">

<t>
This section lists practical considerations for implementors and users. None of
the points below are required but they are recommended for general-purpose
usage.
</t>

<section title="Filename normalization" anchor="filename-normalization">

<t>
  This section provides background information on various challenges caused by
  differences in how operating systems, filesystems, and common tools handle
  filenames followed by a list of recommendations for implementors in
  <xref target="filename-normalization-recommendations" />.
</t>

<section title="Case sensitivity">
  <t>
    There are two challenges for interoperability related to filename case:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        Filesystems such as FAT or EXFAT always convert filenames to uppercase:
        "example.txt" will be stored as "EXAMPLE.TXT"
      </t>
      <t>
        Many Unix filesystems save filenames exactly as provided, allowing
        multiple files which differ only in case: "example.txt" and
        "Example.txt" are separate files
      </t>
      <t>
        NTFS and HFS+ usually preserve case when storing files but are
        case-insensitive when retrieving them. A file saved as "Example.txt"
        will be retrieved by that name but will also be retrieved as
        "EXAMPLE.TXT", "example.txt", etc.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Unicode normalization">

<t>
The Unicode specification has common cases where different character sequences
produce the same human-meaningful text. These are referred to as “canonically
equivalent” and the Unicode specification defines different normalization
forms — see <xref target="UNICODE-TR15" /> for the full details and a brief
example below:

<t>
  Unicode normalization is relevant to BagIt implementors because different
  systems have different standards for normalization:

  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      Apple's HFS Plus filesystem always normalizes filenames to a
      fully-decomposed form based on the Unicode 2.0 specification (see <xref
      target="TN1150" />).
    </t>
    <t>
      Windows treats filenames as opaque character sequences (see <xref
      target="MSFNAM" />) and will store and return the encoded bytes exactly
      as provided.
    </t>
    <t>
      Linux and other common Unix systems are generally similar to Windows in
      storing and returning opaque byte streams but this behaviour is
      technically filesystem-dependent.
    </t>
    <t>
      Utilities used for file management, transfer, and archival may ignore this
      issue, apply an arbitrary normalization form, or allow the user to control
      how normalization is applied.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>

<t>
  In practice, this means that the encoded filename stored in a manifest may
  fail a simple file existence check because the filename's normalization was
  changed at some point after the manifest was written. This situation is very
  confusing for users because the filenames are visually indistinguishable and
  the “missing” file is obviously present in the payload directory.
</t>

<section title="Recommendations" anchor="filename-normalization-recommendations">
  <t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        Implementations &should; discourage the creation of bags containing

      <t>
        Implementations &must; prevent the creation of bags containing files
        which differ only in normalization form.
      </t>
      <t>
        BagIt implementations &should; tolerate differences in normalization
        form by comparing both the list of filesystem and manifest names after
        applying the same normalization form to both.
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations &should; issue a warning when multiple manifests are

<section title="Windows and Unix file naming" anchor="windows-and-unix-file-naming">

<t>
As specified above, only the Unix-based path separator ('/') may be
used inside filenames listed in BagIt manifests files.
When bags are exchanged between Windows and Unix platforms, care should
be taken to translate the path separator as needed. Receivers of bags on
physical media should be prepared for filesystems created under either
Windows or Unix. Besides the fundamental difference between path
separators ('\' and '/'), generally, Windows filesystems have more
limitations than Unix filesystems.
</t>

<figure>
  <preamble>
    Windows path names have a maximum of
    255 characters, and none of these characters may be used in a path
    component:

  </preamble>
 <artwork>
    &lt; &gt; : " / | ? *
 </artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
  <preamble>
    Windows also reserves the following names, with or without a file extension:
  </preamble>
  <artwork>
    CON, PRN, AUX, NUL
    COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9
    LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9

<section title="Legacy checksum tools" anchor="sec-legacy-checksum-tools">

<t>
Some bags have been manually assembled using checksum utilities such as those
contained in the GNU Coreutils package (md5sum, sha1sum, etc.), collectively
referred to here as "md5sum". Implementors who desire wide support of legacy
content should be aware of some known quirks of these tools:
</t>

<t>
md5sum can be run in “text mode” which causes it to normalize line-endings
on some operating systems. On Unix-like systems both modes will usually produce
the same results but on systems like Windows they may produce different results
based on the file contents.

The md5sum output format has two characters between the checksum and the
filename: the first is always a space and the second is an asterisk ("*") for
binary mode and a space for text mode.
</t>

<t>
A final note about md5sum-generated manifests is that for a FILENAME containing
a backslash ('\'), the manifest line will have a backslash inserted in front of
the CHECKSUM and, under Windows, the backslashes inside FILENAME may be doubled.
</t>

<t>
Implementers &may; wish to accept this format by ignoring a leading asterisk or
handling differences in line termination gracefully but, if so, implementations
&must; warn the user that the bag in question will fail strict validation. In
such cases it is strongly encouraged that tools provide an easy option to
update the bag with valid manifests.
