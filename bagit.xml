  <abstract>

<t>
This document specifies BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format for
storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" has just enough
structure to enclose descriptive "tags" and a "payload" but
does not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics.  This
BagIt format should be suitable for disk-based or network-based storage and
transfer.
</t>

<section title="Introduction">
<section title="Purpose">
<t>
BagIt is a hierarchical file packaging format designed to support
disk-based or network-based storage and transfer of arbitrary digital
content.  A bag consists of a "payload" and "tags".  The content of the payload
is the custodial focus of the bag and is treated as semantically opaque.
The "tags" are metadata files intended to facilitate and document the storage
and transfer of the bag.  The name, BagIt, is inspired by the "enclose and deposit" method
<xref target="ENCDEP" />, sometimes referred to as "bag it and tag it".
</t>

<!-- TODO: Move this section into the Interoperabiliyt section. -->
<t>
Implementors of BagIt tools should consider interoperability
between different platforms, operating systems, toolsets, and languages.
Differences in path separators, newline characters, reserved
file names, and maximum path lengths are all possible barriers to 
moving bags between different systems.  Discussion of these issues may be
found in the Interoperability section of this document.
</t>
</section> <!-- /Purpose -->
	
<section title="Requirements">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

<t>
An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or
more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols
it implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or
REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols
is said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all
the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements 
for its protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

This specification uses a number of terms to describe BagIt, some
of which are in common use, some of which are newly defined by this

directory; and (3) a set of optional tag directories. The payload files in the
payload directory are an arbitrary file hierarchy
(see <xref target="sec-payload-dir" />).
The tag files in the base directory consist of one or more files named
"manifest-<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx>.txt"
(see <xref target="sec-payload-manifest" />), a file named "bagit.txt"
(see <xref target="sec-bag-decl" />), and zero or more additional tag
files (see <xref target="sec-optional-elements" />). The tag files in the
optional tag directories are arbitrary file hierarchies and the tag directories
&may; have any name that is not reserved for a file or directory in this specification.

<!-- WARNING: This section should be kept in relative sync with the

<t>
A payload manifest is a tag file that lists payload files and checksums for those
payload files generated using a particular bag checksum algorithm.
Every bag &must; contain one payload manifest file, and &may; contain
more than one. A payload manifest file &must;
have a name of the form manifest-<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx>.txt, where
<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx> is a string specifying
the bag checksum algorithm used in that manifest, such as:
</t>

<figure>
 <artwork>
manifest-md5.txt
manifest-sha1.txt
 </artwork>
</figure>

<t>A bag &must-not; contain more than one payload manifest for a particular
bag checksum algorithm.</t>
<t>
Each line of a payload manifest file &must; be of the form:
</t>

<figure>
 <artwork>
CHECKSUM FILENAME
 </artwork>
</figure>

<t>
where FILENAME is the pathname of a file relative to the base directory
and CHECKSUM is a hex-encoded checksum calculated according to <spanx
style="emph">algorithm</spanx> over every octet in the file. The hex-encoded
checksum &may; use uppercase and/or lowercase letters.  The slash
character ('/') &must; be used as a path separator in FILENAME. One
or more linear whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) &must; separate
CHECKSUM from FILENAME.  An asterisk ('*') &may; preceed FILENAME for
interoperability on some platforms (see <xref target="sec-checksum-tools"
/>). There is no limitation on the length of a pathname. The payload
manifest &must-not; reference files outside the payload directory.
</t>

<t>
Payload manifests only include the pathnames of files.  Because of this,
a payload manifest cannot reference empty directories.  To account for 
an empty directory, a bag creator may wish to include at least one file 
in that directory; it suffices, for example, to include a zero-length 
file named ".keep".

A tag manifest is a tag file that lists other tag files and checksums for
those tag files generated using a particular bag checksum algorithm.
A bag &may; contain one or more tag manifests.
A tag manifest file &must; have a name of the form

<section title="Bag Metadata: bag-info.txt">

<t>
The "bag-info.txt" file is a tag file that contains metadata elements
describing the bag and the payload.  The metadata elements contained in
the "bag-info.txt" file are intended primarily for human readability.
All metadata elements are optional and &may; be repeated. Implementations
&should; assume that the ordering is significant and provide access to the
metadata elements in the order they are given in the "bag-info.txt" file. 
</t>
<t>
A metadata element &must; consist of a label, a colon, and a value,
each separated by optional whitespace.  It is &recommended; that
lines not exceed 79 characters in length. Long values may be continued
onto the next line by inserting a newline (LF), a carriage return (CR),
or carriage return plus newline (CRLF) and indenting the next line with
linear white space (spaces or tabs).

<section title="Fetch File: fetch.txt" anchor="sec-fetch-file">

<t>
For reasons of efficiency, a bag &may; be sent with a list of files to be
fetched and added to the payload before it can meaningfully be checked
for completeness.  An &optional; tag file named "fetch.txt"
contains such a list.  Each line of "fetch.txt" has the form

<figure>
 <artwork>
URL LENGTH FILENAME
 </artwork>
</figure>

where URL identifies the file to be fetched, LENGTH is the number of
octets in the file (or "-", to leave it unspecified), and FILENAME
identifies the corresponding payload file, relative to the base directory.
The slash character ('/') &must; be used as a path separator in FILENAME.
If FILENAME begins with a slash character, the destination &must; still be
treated as relative to the bag base directory.
One or more linear whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) &must; separate these
three values, and any such characters in the URL &must; be percent-encoded
<xref target="RFC3986"/>.  There is no limitation on the length of any
of the fields in the "fetch.txt".
</t>

<t>
The "fetch.txt" file allows a bag to be transmitted with
"holes" in it, which can be practical for several reasons.  For example,
it obviates the need for the sender to stage a large serialized copy of
the content while the bag is transferred to the receiver.  Also, this
method allows a sender to construct a bag from components that are either
a subset of logically related components (e.g., the localized logical
object could be much larger than what is intended for export) or
assembled from logically distributed sources (e.g., the object components
for export are not stored locally under one filesystem tree).
</t>

<section title="Other Tag Files" anchor="sec-other-tag-files">
<t>
A bag &may; contain other tag files that are not defined by this
specification.
Implementations &should; ignore the content of any unexpected tag files,
except when they are listed in a tag manifest.
When unexpected tag files are listed in a tag manifest, implementations
&must; only treat the content of those tag files as octet streams for the
purpose of checksum verification.

<t>
Text tag files are line-oriented, and each line &must; be
terminated by a newline (LF), a carriage return (CR), or carriage return
plus newline (CRLF).
Text tag files &must; end in the extension ".txt".
</t>

<t>
In all text tag files except for the bag declaration file, text &must; be 
encoded in the character encoding specified in the "bagit.txt" bag declaration 
file.  Text tag files except for the bag declaration file &may; include a
byte-order mark (BOM) only if the specified encoding requires it for
proper decoding.  (Note that UTF-8 does not.)

If a bag is neither valid, complete, nor incomplete, it is
<spanx style="emph">invalid</spanx>.  Definitions for the various
ways a bag may be invalid are not covered by this specification.

<t>
Tag files that do not appear in a tag manifest can be modified, added 
to, or removed from a bag without impacting the completeness or validity 
of the bag.
</t>

</section> <!-- Completeness and validity -->

<section title="Serialization" anchor="sec-serialization">

<t>
In some scenarios, it may be convenient to serialize the 
bag's filesystem hierarchy (i.e., the base directory) into a
single-file archive format such as TAR or ZIP (the serialization) and then
later deserialize the serialization to recreate the filesystem  hierarchy.
Several rules govern the serialization of a bag and apply equally
to all types of archive files:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
The top-level directory of a serialization &must; contain only one bag.
</t>
<t>
The serialization &should; have the same name as the bag's base directory,
but &must; have an extension added to identify the format.  For example, the
receiver of "mybag.tar.gz" expects the corresponding base directory
to be created as "mybag".
</t>
<t>
A bag &must-not; be serialized from within its base directory, but from the
parent of the base directory (where the base directory appears as an
entry).  Thus, after a bag is deserialized in an empty directory,
a listing of that directory shows exactly one entry.  For example,
deserializing "mybag.zip" in an empty directory causes the creation
of the base directory "mybag" and, beneath "mybag", the creation of
all payload and tag files.
</t>
<t>
The deserialization of a bag &must; produce a single base directory
bag with the top-level structure as described in this specification without
requiring any additional un-archiving step.  For example, after one
un-archiving step it would be an error for the "data/" directory to
appear as "data.tar.gz".  TAR and ZIP files may appear inside the payload
beneath the "data/" directory, where they would be treated
as any other payload file.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
When serializing a bag, care must be taken to
ensure that the archive format's restrictions on file naming, such as allowable
characters, length, or character encoding, will support the
requirements of the systems on which it will be used.  See 
<xref target="sec-interoperability" />.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security">

<section title="Special directory characters">
<!-- Added by Brian Vargas, 2009-04-09 -->
<t>
The paths specified in the payload manifest, tag manifest, and
"fetch.txt" file do not prohibit special directory characters which might be
significant on implementing systems.  Implementors &should; take care that
files outside the bag directory structure are not accessed when reading or
writing files based on paths specified in a bag.
</t>

<t>
For example, path characters such as ".." or "~"
in a maliciously crafted "fetch.txt" file might cause a naive implementation to
overwrite critical system files.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Control of URLs in fetch.txt">
<t>
Implementors of tools that complete bags by retrieving URLs listed in a
"fetch.txt" file need to be aware that some of those URLs may point to hosts,
intentionally or unintentionally, that are not under control of the bag's
sender. Checksums are intended as a reasonable guarantee against corruption
during transit, not a strong cryptographic protection against intentional
spoofing.
</t>
</section>

<section title="File sizes in fetch.txt">
<!-- Added by Brian Vargas, 2009-04-09 -->
<t>
The size of files, as optionally reported in the "fetch.txt" file, cannot be
guaranteed to match the actual file size to be downloaded.  Implementors &should;
take care to appropriately handle cases where the actual file size does not
match the file size reported in the fetch.txt.  Implementors &should-not; use
the file size in the "fetch.txt" file for critical resource allocation, such as
buffer sizing or storage requisitioning.
</t>
</section>

</section> <!-- End Section: Security considerations -->

<section title="Practical Considerations (non-normative)">
<section title="Disk and network transfer">

<t>
When creating a bag on physical media (such as hard disk, CD-ROM, or 
DVD) for transfer to another organization, the sender should select 
and format the media in a manner compatible with both the content 
requirements (e.g., file names and sizes) and the receiver's technical 
infrastructure.  If the receiver's infrastructure is not known or the 
media needs to be compatible with a range of potential receivers, 
consideration should be given to portability and common usage.  For 
example, a "lowest common denominator" for some potential receivers 
could be USB disk drives formatted with the FAT32 filesystem.
</t>

<t>
Although overall bag size is unlimited in principle, network-based 
transfers may involve constraints on the amount of bag data that a 
receiver can receive at one time.  It may be practical to split a 
large bag into several smaller bags.
</t>

<t>
Transmitting a whole bag in serialized form as a single file will tend
to be the most straightforward mode of transfer.  When throughput is a
priority, use of "fetch.txt" lends itself to an easy, application-level
parallelism in which the list of URL-addressed items to fetch is divided
among multiple processes.
The mechanics of sending and receiving bags over networks is otherwise
out of scope of the present document and may be facilitated by protocols
such as <xref target="GRABIT" /> and <xref target="SWORD" />.
</t>

</section> <!-- /Network and Disk Transfers -->

<section title="Interoperability" anchor="sec-interoperability">

<t>
This section is not part of the BagIt specification.  It describes some
practical considerations for bag creators and receivers circa 2010.
</t>

<section title="Checksum tools" anchor="sec-checksum-tools">

<t>
Some cautions regarding bag interchange arise in regard to the
commonly available checksum tools distributed with the GNU Coreutils
package (md5sum, sha1sum, etc.), collectively referred to here as
"md5sum".  First, md5sum can be run in binary or text
mode; text mode sometimes normalizes line-endings.  While these
modes appear to produce the same checksums under Unix-like systems, they
can produce different checksums under Windows.  When using md5sum, it 
may be safest to run it in binary mode, with one caveat:  a side-effect
of binary mode is that md5sum requires a space and an asterisk ('*'),
compared to two spaces in text mode, between the CHECKSUM and FILENAME in
its manifest format.
</t>

<t>
Due to the widespread use of md5sum (and its relatives), it is not
unexpected for bag receivers to see manifests in which CHECKSUM and
FILENAME are separated by a space followed by an asterisk.  Implementors
creating or processing bags with md5sum should be aware of these subtle
differences, and ensure compliance with the manifest specification in this
document.  Implementors creating and processing bags with other tools may wish
to be tolerant of asterisks found in the manifests.
</t>

<t>A final note about md5sum-generated manifests is that for a
FILENAME containing a backslash ('\'), the manifest line will have a
backslash inserted in front of the CHECKSUM and, under Windows, the
backslashes inside FILENAME may be doubled.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Windows and Unix file naming">

<t>
As specified above, only the Unix-based path separator ('/') may be
used inside filenames listed in BagIt manifests and "fetch.txt" files.
When bags are exchanged between Windows and Unix platforms, care should
be taken to translate the path separator as needed.  Receivers of bags on
physical media should be prepared for filesystems created under either
Windows or Unix.  Besides the fundamental difference between path
separators ('\' and '/'), generally, Windows filesystems have more
limitations than Unix filesystems.  Windows path names have a maximum of
255 characters, and none of these characters may be used in a path
component:

<figure>
 <artwork>
    &lt; &gt; : " / | ? *
 </artwork>
</figure>

Windows also reserves the following names:  CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1,
COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4,
LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.  See <xref target="MSFNAM" /> for more

</section>

<section title="Changes from draft-02, 2008.07.11">

<t>
Added language to require the slash ('/') as path separator,
regardless of the platform where the bag was created.
Added an extra co-author and an Acknowledgements section.
</t>

<t>
Deleted the unnecessary "(optional)" from four of the metadata elements,
since all metadata elements are optional.  Softened the equivalence of
the serialization name and name of the contained bag base directory.
Replaced the reference to RFC2822 with an inline description of the
simpler bag-info.txt format.
</t>

<t>
Changed to a variable linear whitespace separator in the description
of manifest layout and in manifest examples.
Added two paragraphs under a new "Checksum tools" subsection of the
Interoperability section to describe some of the peculiarities of
dealing with the widely used GNU Coreutils checksum tools.
</t>

<t>
With the new version, 0.96, there is an important and incompatible change
of file name (package-info.txt -&gt; bag-info.txt), metadata element names
(Package-Size -&gt; Bag-Size, Packing-Date -&gt; Bagging-Date), and
descriptive language to replace the noun "package" with "bag" throughout
the spec.  This was to reduce unnecessary synonymy and free up the noun
"package" to name the physical container (e.g., a mailing carton) used to
transfer hard disks.
</t>

<t>
In section 7, another important change is the introduction of the
Payload-Oxum ("octetstream sum") metadata element to convey precise,
machine-readable payload size information for capacity planning
(especially useful when preparing to receive files listed in fetch.txt).
The Bag-size definition was adjusted to steer it more towards human
consumption.
</t>

<t>
In section 2.2 the spec now requires exactly two spaces between checksum
and filename in manifests.  This results from the experience that as of
2008, not all widely available validation tools are flexible in the
kind of separating whitespace recognized.  The examples have been
updated to include use the two-space form as well.
</t>

<t>
Comment added that while overall bag size is unlimited, practical
limitations on the amount of data that a receiver can stage may
warrant splitting a large bag into several smaller bags.
</t>

<t>
Added a reference to the SWORD protocol.
</t>

<t>
Minor edits for scanning and reformatting to cut down line length for
some figures that exceeded 72 chars (limit for Internet-Drafts).
</t>

</section>

<section title="Changes from draft-01, 2008.05.30">

<t>
Added mention of preserving empty directories.
</t>

<t>
Simplified function of "tag checksum file" to "tag manifest", having same
format as payload manifest.  The tag manifest is optional and need not
include every tag file.
</t>

<t>
Loosened interpretation of payload manifest to "union" concept:
every payload file must be listed in at least one manifest but
need not be listed in every manifest.
</t>

<t>
Shortened the Introduction's first paragraph to be less duplicative
of text in the Abstract.
</t>

<t>
Changed Delivery-Date to Packing-Date.
</t>

<t>
Correctly sorted the author list and clarification of
deserialization wording.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Changes from draft-00, 2008.03.24">

<t>
Author address corrections and miscellaneous stylistic edits.
