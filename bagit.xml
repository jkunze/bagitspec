<t>
This document specifies BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format for
storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" has just enough
structure to enclose descriptive "tags" and a "payload" but
does not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics.  This
BagIt format should be suitable for disk-based or network-based storage and
transfer.
</t>

<section title="Introduction">
<section title="Purpose">
<t>
BagIt is a hierarchical file packaging format designed to support
disk-based or network-based storage and transfer of arbitrary digital
content.  A bag consists of a "payload" and "tags".  The content of the payload
is the custodial focus of the bag and is treated as semantically opaque.
The "tags" are metadata files intended to facilitate and document the storage
and transfer of the bag.  The name, BagIt, is inspired by the "enclose and deposit" method
<xref target="ENCDEP" />, sometimes referred to as "bag it and tag it".
</t>

<!-- TODO: Move this section into the Interoperabiliyt section. -->
<t>
Implementors of BagIt tools should consider interoperability
between different platforms, operating systems, toolsets, and languages.
Differences in path separators, newline characters, reserved
file names, and maximum path lengths are all possible barriers to 
moving bags between different systems.  Discussion of these issues may be
found in the Interoperability section of this document.

<t>
A bag consists of a base directory containing (1) a set of required
and optional tag files; (2) a sub-directory named "data", called the payload
directory; and (3) a set of optional tag directories. The payload files in the
payload directory are an arbitrary file hierarchy
(see <xref target="sec-payload-dir" />).
The tag files in the base directory consist of one or more files named
"manifest-<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx>.txt"
(see <xref target="sec-payload-manifest" />), a file named "bagit.txt"
(see <xref target="sec-bag-decl" />), and zero or more additional tag
files (see <xref target="sec-optional-elements" />). The tag files in the
optional tag directories are arbitrary file hierarchies and the tag directories
&may; have any name that is not reserved for a file or directory in this specification. 
</t>

<!-- WARNING: This section should be kept in relative sync with the
              section on Tag Manifests.
-->
<t>
A payload manifest is a tag file that lists payload files and checksums for those
payload files generated using a particular bag checksum algorithm.
Every bag &must; contain one payload manifest file, and &may; contain
more than one. If there is more than one, each payload manifest 
file must list all payload files. A payload manifest file &must;
have a name of the form manifest-<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx>.txt, where
<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx> is a string specifying
the bag checksum algorithm used in that manifest, such as:
</t>

<figure>
 <artwork>
manifest-md5.txt
manifest-sha1.txt
 </artwork>
</figure>

<t>A bag &must-not; contain more than one payload manifest for a particular
bag checksum algorithm.</t>
<t>
Each line of a payload manifest file &must; be of the form:
</t>

<figure>
 <artwork>
CHECKSUM FILENAME
 </artwork>
</figure>

<t>
where FILENAME is the pathname of a file relative to the base directory, 
 and CHECKSUM is a hex-encoded checksum calculated according to <spanx
  style="emph">algorithm</spanx> over every octet in the file.
The hex-encoded checksum &may; use uppercase and/or lowercase letters.  The slash
character ('/') &must; be used as a path separator in FILENAME. One
or more linear whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) &must; separate
CHECKSUM from FILENAME. There is no limitation on the length of a pathname. 
The payload manifest &must-not; reference files outside the payload directory. If
a FILENAME includes a newline (LF), a carriage return (CR), or carriage
return plus newline (CRLF) it &must; be percent-encoded 
<xref target="RFC3986"/>.

</t>

<t>
Payload manifests only include the pathnames of files.  Because of this,
a payload manifest cannot reference empty directories.  To account for 
an empty directory, a bag creator may wish to include at least one file 
in that directory; it suffices, for example, to include a zero-length 
file named ".keep".
</t>

<t>
A tag manifest is a tag file that lists other tag files and checksums for
those tag files generated using a particular bag checksum algorithm.
A bag &may; contain one or more tag manifests.
A tag manifest file &must; have a name of the form
"tagmanifest-<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx>.txt", where
<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx> is a string specifying
the bag checksum algorithm used in that manifest, such as:

<t>
A tag manifest file has the same form as the payload file manifest
file described in <xref target="sec-payload-manifest" />,
but &must-not; list any payload files.
As a result, no FILENAME listed in a tag manifest begins "data/".
</t>

</section> <!-- /Tag Manifest -->

<section title="Bag Metadata: bag-info.txt">

<t>
The "bag-info.txt" file is a tag file that contains metadata elements
describing the bag and the payload.  The metadata elements contained in
the "bag-info.txt" file are intended primarily for human readability.
All metadata elements are optional and &may; be repeated. Implementations
&must; assume that the ordering is significant and provide access to the
metadata elements in the order they are given in the "bag-info.txt" file. 
</t>
<t>
A metadata element &must; consist of a label, a colon, and a value,
each separated by optional whitespace.  It is &recommended; that
lines not exceed 79 characters in length. Long values may be continued
onto the next line by inserting a newline (LF), a carriage return (CR),
or carriage return plus newline (CRLF) and indenting the next line with
linear white space (spaces or tabs).
</t>
<t>
A implementation &may; assume the metadata element Payload-Oxum exists
for the purpose of quickly verifying the bag. If it does exist it &must;
be in the form as defined as follows:
</t>
<t hangText="Payload-Oxum">
    The "octetstream sum" of the payload, namely, a two-part number
    of the form "OctetCount.StreamCount", where OctetCount is the
    total number of octets (8-bit bytes) across all payload file content
    and StreamCount is the total number of payload files.  Payload-Oxum
    should be included in "bag-info.txt" if at all
    possible.  Compared to Bag-Size (above), Payload-Oxum is
    intended for machine consumption.

<t>
A bag &may; contain other tag files that are not defined by this
specification.
Implementations &should; ignore the content of any unexpected tag files,

<section title="Bag Checksum Algorithms" anchor="bag-checksum-algorithms">

<t>
The name of the checksum algorithm &must; be normalized for use in the 
manifest's filename by lowercasing the common name of the algorithm and 
removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

ways a bag may be invalid are not covered by this specification.
</t>

<t>
Tag files that do not appear in a tag manifest can be modified, added 
to, or removed from a bag without impacting the completeness or validity 
of the bag.
</t>

</section> <!-- Completeness and validity -->

<section title="Serialization" anchor="sec-serialization">

<t>
In some scenarios, it may be convenient to serialize the 
bag's filesystem hierarchy (i.e., the base directory) into a
single-file archive format such as TAR or ZIP (the serialization) and then
later deserialize the serialization to recreate the filesystem  hierarchy.
Several rules govern the serialization of a bag and apply equally
to all types of archive files:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
The top-level directory of a serialization &must; contain only one bag.
</t>
<t>
The serialization &should; have the same name as the bag's base directory,
but &must; have an extension added to identify the format.  For example, the
receiver of "mybag.tar.gz" expects the corresponding base directory
to be created as "mybag".
</t>
<t>
A bag &must-not; be serialized from within its base directory, but from the
parent of the base directory (where the base directory appears as an
entry).  Thus, after a bag is deserialized in an empty directory,
a listing of that directory shows exactly one entry.  For example,
deserializing "mybag.zip" in an empty directory causes the creation
of the base directory "mybag" and, beneath "mybag", the creation of
all payload and tag files.
</t>
<t>
The deserialization of a bag &must; produce a single base directory
bag with the top-level structure as described in this specification without
requiring any additional un-archiving step.  For example, after one
un-archiving step it would be an error for the "data/" directory to
appear as "data.tar.gz".  TAR and ZIP files may appear inside the payload
beneath the "data/" directory, where they would be treated
as any other payload file.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
When serializing a bag, care must be taken to
ensure that the archive format's restrictions on file naming, such as allowable
characters, length, or character encoding, will support the
requirements of the systems on which it will be used.  See 
<xref target="sec-interoperability" />.

<section title="Optional file metadata">

<t>
The "bag-info.txt", if present, may contain optional file metadata
elements.  It describes the bag contributions made my individual
files in the files-<spanx style="emph">algorithm</spanx>.txt
file.  File contribution elements have the form

<figure>
 <artwork>
    file: &lt;filepattern&gt; | &lt;prose description of contribution&gt;
 </artwork>
</figure>

where <spanx style="emph">filepattern</spanx> is either a literal
filename exactly as it appears in the manifest or a string (a pattern)
consisting of literal and wildcards '?' (matching any single character)
or '*' (matching any number of characters).  For example,

<figure>
 <artwork>
    file: notes.txt | curatorial decision notes
    file: *.lo_res.jpg | low resolution derivative images
    file: *.tiff | high resolution master images

<section title="Special directory characters">
<!-- Added by Brian Vargas, 2009-04-09 -->
<t>
The paths specified in the payload manifest, and tag manifest
file do not prohibit special directory characters which might be
significant on implementing systems.  Implementors &should; take care that
files outside the bag directory structure are not accessed when reading or
writing files based on paths specified in a bag.
</t>

<t>
For example, path characters such as ".." or "~"
in a maliciously crafted "tagmanifest-md5.txt" file might cause a naive implementation to
overwrite critical system files.

<section title="Practical Considerations (non-normative)">
<section title="Disk and network transfer">

<t>
When creating a bag on physical media (such as hard disk, CD-ROM, or 
DVD) for transfer to another organization, the sender should select 
and format the media in a manner compatible with both the content 
requirements (e.g., file names and sizes) and the receiver's technical 
infrastructure.  If the receiver's infrastructure is not known or the 
media needs to be compatible with a range of potential receivers, 
consideration should be given to portability and common usage.  For 
example, a "lowest common denominator" for some potential receivers 
could be USB disk drives formatted with the FAT32 filesystem.
</t>

<t>
Although overall bag size is unlimited in principle, network-based 
transfers may involve constraints on the amount of bag data that a 
receiver can receive at one time.  It may be practical to split a 
large bag into several smaller bags.
</t>

<t>
The mechanics of sending and receiving bags over networks is otherwise
out of scope of the present document and may be facilitated by protocols
such as <xref target="GRABIT" /> and <xref target="SWORD" />.
</t>

<section title="Interoperability" anchor="sec-interoperability">

<t>
This section is not part of the BagIt specification.  It describes some
practical considerations for bag creators and receivers circa 2016.
</t>

<section title="Checksum tools" anchor="sec-checksum-tools">

<t>
Some cautions regarding bag interchange arise in regard to the
commonly available checksum tools distributed with the GNU Coreutils
package (md5sum, sha1sum, etc.), collectively referred to here as
"md5sum".  First, md5sum can be run in binary or text
mode; text mode sometimes normalizes line-endings.  While these
modes appear to produce the same checksums under Unix-like systems, they
can produce different checksums under Windows.  When using md5sum, you
&should; always run it in binary mode.
</t>

<t>
Due to the widespread use of md5sum (and its relatives), it is not
unexpected for bag receivers to see manifests in which CHECKSUM and
FILENAME are separated by a space followed by an asterisk.  Implementors
creating or processing bags with md5sum should be aware of these subtle
differences, and ensure compliance with the manifest specification in this
document.  Implementors creating and processing bags with other tools may wish
to be tolerant of asterisks found in the manifests.
</t>

<t>A final note about md5sum-generated manifests is that for a
FILENAME containing a backslash ('\'), the manifest line will have a
backslash inserted in front of the CHECKSUM and, under Windows, the
backslashes inside FILENAME may be doubled.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Windows and Unix file naming">

<t>
As specified above, only the Unix-based path separator ('/') may be
used inside filenames listed in BagIt manifests files.
When bags are exchanged between Windows and Unix platforms, care should
be taken to translate the path separator as needed.  Receivers of bags on
physical media should be prepared for filesystems created under either
Windows or Unix.  Besides the fundamental difference between path
separators ('\' and '/'), generally, Windows filesystems have more
limitations than Unix filesystems.  Windows path names have a maximum of
255 characters, and none of these characters may be used in a path
component:

<figure>
 <artwork>
    &lt; &gt; : " / | ? *
 </artwork>
</figure>

Windows also reserves the following names:  CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1,
COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4,
LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.  See <xref target="MSFNAM" /> for more
information.
